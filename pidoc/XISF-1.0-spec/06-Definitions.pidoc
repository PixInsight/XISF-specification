   The following subsections form a non-normative collection of important terms and concepts identified during the production of this document. They are included here for informational/reference purposes only.

   \definition {

      {
         An 8-bit unsigned binary integer.
      }

      { File }
      {
         A file is a finite ordered sequence of \e N 8-bit contiguous bytes, where \e N is the file length and bytes are numbered from 0 to \e{N}--1. The \e theoretical maximum file length is 2\sup{64}--1 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 bytes.

      { File system }
      {
         A file system allows software applications to store and retrieve files on storage devices. Files are usually organized in a hierarchical structure of \e directories (also known as \e {folders}). Files and directories can be accessed through identifying \e {names}.

      { Scalar }
      {
         A single value without internal structure, such as an integer or a floating point number.

      { Homogeneous structure }
      {
         A structure that can only contain objects of the same class or data type.
      }

      { Heterogeneous structure }
      {

      }

      { Finite sequence }
      {
         A sequence containing a finite number of objects. The number of contained objects in a finite sequence is normally called its \e length.
      }

      { Ordered sequence }
      {
         A sequence where the relative locations of its contained objects is a relevant property of the sequence itself.
      }

      { Sorted sequence }
      {
         An ordered sequence where the relative locations of its contained objects are functions of their values.
      }

      { Complex number }
      {
         A number that can be expressed in the form \im{a + bi}, where \im{a} and \im{b} are real numbers and \im{i} is the \e {imaginary unit}, which is defined by the equation \im{#: i^2 = -1 :#}. The components \im{a} and \im{b} of a complex number are called its \e real and \e imaginary parts or components.

      {
         A heterogeneous, finite set of objects, structured as a two-dimensional array with a fixed number of rows and columns. The structure of a table object is explicitly defined by describing the types and order of the objects contained in a table row.
      }

      { String }
      {
         A homogeneous, finite ordered sequence of zero or more Unicode\ref unicode_standard code points represented as integer scalars.
      }

      { Case-sensitive }
      {
         A text property, such as the name or identifier of an object or data item, which distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, the words "thisIsFoo" and "thisisfoo" are different if considered as case-sensitive.
      }

      { Case-insensitive }
      {
         A text property, such as the name or identifier of an object or data item, which does not distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters. For example, the words "FooBar" and "foobar" are equivalent if considered as case-insensitive.
      }

      { Little-endian }
      {
         A data encoding where the bytes within a 16-bit or larger scalar are addressed from the least significant to the most significant as the byte address increases.
      }

      { Big-endian }
      {
         A data encoding where the bytes within a 16-bit or larger scalar are addressed from the most significant to the least significant as the byte address increases.
