\section { Availability and Use of XISF } {

   XISF has been conceived as a free, open format since its origin. The words \e free and \e open formally mean the following:

   \list[ordered,spaced] {

      { The entire definition of XISF \e shall be publicly available without any restrictions or monetary cost to anyone. }

      { Anyone \e shall be able to use or implement XISF freely without any monetary cost for any purpose. }

      { XISF \e shall \e not be subject to patents or royalties of any kind that could limit its availability or impose a monetary cost for its availability or its use. }

      { These conditions \e shall constitute a legally binding assignment, and no individual or organization that implements, extends or redefines XISF in the future will be able to revoke or limit them under any circumstance. }
   }
