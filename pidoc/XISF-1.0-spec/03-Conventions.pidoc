      The key words \e must, \e {must not}, \e required, \e shall, \e {shall not}, \e should, \e {should not}, \e recommended, \e may, and \e optional in this document, when \e emphasized, are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.\ref rfc_2119
   }

   \subsection { Typographical Conventions } {

      \list[spaced] {
         {
            \c {Monospaced text} represents literal source code fragments.
         }

         {
            \c\e {Italicized monospace text} represents metalanguage fragments describing source code elements:

               \block[marginLeft:2em] {
                  \c { \hs\hs\hs name="\e{value}" }

                  In this example, the word \c\e value is a metasymbol used to describe the value of a \c name XML attribute.
               }
         }

         {
            In code fragments, an ellipsis represents a variable-length list of items:

               \block[marginLeft:2em] {
                  \c { \hs\hs\hs \e{item}\sub{1}:...:\e{item}\sub{N} }

                  This example shows a list of N items separated by literal colon '\c{:}' characters. Note that the \c\e{item}\sub{i} elements are metasymbols in this case, not literal fragments.
               }
         }

         {
            Portions of this document enclosed by gray dashed lines represent literal source code examples:

               \block[marginLeft:2em] {
                  \code {
         This is a source code example.
                  }

                  Literal source code fragments do not necessarily correspond to working code examples. When necessary or not obvious, this is indicated in the text describing the examples.
               }
         }

         {
            The subindexes \sub{2} \sub{8} \sub{10} and \sub{16} indicate base 2 (or binary), base 8 (octal), base 10 (decimal), and base 16 (hexadecimal) integers, respectively. For example:

               \block[marginLeft:2em] {

                  76\sub{10} = 4C\sub{16}
               }
         }

         {
            Figures are for illustration only; unless explicitly stated, they are not reference renderings.
         }
      }
   }
