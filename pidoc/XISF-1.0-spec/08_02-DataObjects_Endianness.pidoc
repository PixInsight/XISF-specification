\subsection { \label endianness Endianness } {

   All the data stored in an \lref xisf_unit {XISF unit}, including \lref xisf_header {XISF headers}, \lref data_blocks_file {XISF data blocks files} and all \lref data_block {XISF data blocks}, \e shall be encoded as \s little-endian.

   The \e only exception to this rule occurs when an object in another format requiring big endian encoding has to be embedded in an XISF unit. \lref iccprofile_core_element {ICC color profiles}\ref icc_profile are the most frequent instances of this exception.

   The contents of external files not encoded as XISF data blocks, which can be referenced from \lref distributed_xisf_unit {distributed XISF unit} headers, are out of the scope of this specification. Therefore, the endianness of these files and the way they are used are the responsibility of the decoders and applications accessing them.
