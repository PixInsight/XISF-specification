\subsection { \label endianness Endianness } {

   All the data stored in an \lref xisf_unit {XISF unit}, including \lref xisf_header {XISF headers}, \lref data_blocks_file {XISF data blocks files} and all \lref data_block {XISF data blocks}, \e shall be encoded as \s little-endian.

   The \e only exception to this rule occurs when an object in another format requiring big endian encoding has to be embedded in an XISF unit. \lref iccprofile_core_element {ICC color profiles}\ref icc_profile are the most frequent instances of this exception.

   The contents of external files not encoded as XISF data blocks, which can be referenced from distributed XISF unit headers, are out of the scope of this specification. Therefore, the endianness of these files and the way they are used are the responsibility of the decoders and applications accessing them.
